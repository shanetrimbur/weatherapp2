# Weather App Project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to fetch weather data from multiple sources, store it in Azure Blob Storage, and then serve that data through a Node.js API. The data can be accessed and displayed on a frontend weather dashboard. The project currently uses aviation weather data, but it can be easily expanded to pull data from multiple weather sources and services.

### Key Technologies:
- **Python**: Used for scraping and uploading weather data to Azure Blob Storage.
- **Node.js (Express)**: Backend API that serves weather data from Azure.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Cloud storage solution to store and manage weather data.
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**: A simple frontend to display the weather data fetched from the backend.

## How It Works

### Backend

The backend consists of two major components:

1. **Python Weather Data Scraper (`weatherdatascraper.py`)**:
   - The Python script fetches weather data (in JSON format) from an aviation weather API.
   - It uploads the fetched weather data to Azure Blob Storage.
   - The script uses the `requests` library to make API calls and the `azure-storage-blob` library to interact with Azure.
   - The Azure connection string is securely stored in the `.env` file.

2. **Node.js Server (`server.js`)**:
   - The Node.js server exposes an API endpoint (`/weather`) that retrieves the latest weather data from Azure Blob Storage.
   - The server uses the `express` library to handle HTTP requests and the `azure/storage-blob` library to interact with Azure Blob Storage.
   - The data fetched from Azure is returned to the frontend in JSON format.

### Frontend

- The frontend is a simple HTML page that uses JavaScript to make an API call to the Node.js backend and fetch the weather data.
- The data is then dynamically displayed on the webpage using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** and **pip** for the Python script.
- **Node.js 18.x** and **npm** for the Node.js backend.
- **Azure Account** with a Blob Storage setup.
- **Azure Storage SDK** for Python and Node.js.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   Navigate to the Python script directory and install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   cd backend/python-scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt is present
   ```

   Alternatively, install these packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install requests azure-storage-blob python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   Navigate to the Node.js server directory and install the required Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   cd ../node
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - In both the Python and Node.js `.env` files, add your Azure connection string.
     ```
     AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
     ```

## Running the Project

### 1. Running the Python Scraper
The Python scraper is used to fetch the weather data from the aviation weather API and upload it to Azure Blob Storage.

```bash
cd backend/python-scripts
python weatherdatascraper.py
```

Once this script runs successfully, it will upload the weather data to Azure Blob Storage.

### 2. Running the Node.js Backend
The Node.js backend is used to serve the weather data stored in Azure Blob Storage via an API.

```bash
cd backend/node
node server.js
```

Once the server is running, you can access the weather data API at `http://localhost:3000/weather`.

### 3. Viewing the Frontend
Open the `index.html` file from the `frontend` folder in your browser to view the weather dashboard:
```
frontend/index.html
```

This will display the weather data fetched from the backend API.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as a basic template for fetching weather data and storing it in Azure, but there are several ways to extend and improve it:

### 1. **Multiple Weather Sources**:
   - You could integrate more weather data sources (e.g., OpenWeather, Weather.com API) to enrich the available data.
   - Create a system that allows toggling between different sources on the frontend.

### 2. **Scheduling Data Updates**:
   - Implement a scheduler (e.g., using cron jobs) to automatically fetch and update weather data periodically instead of manually running the scraper script.
   - This would allow for up-to-date weather information without needing user intervention.

### 3. **Improved Frontend**:
   - Replace the current static HTML/CSS frontend with a modern framework like **React** or **Vue.js**.
   - Create charts or visualizations (using libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js**) to make the data more user-friendly.
   - Add features like weather search by location, or forecasts for the upcoming days.

### 4. **Dockerize the Project**:
   - Package the Python scraper and the Node.js server into Docker containers, making it easier to deploy and scale the application in different environments.
   - Use a Docker Compose file to manage multiple containers.

### 5. **Authentication and Security**:
   - Add user authentication (e.g., using **JWT tokens**) to restrict access to the API.
   - Implement HTTPS to secure data transfer between the frontend, backend, and Azure.

### 6. **Database Integration**:
   - Instead of fetching weather data directly from Azure Blob Storage each time, integrate a database (e.g., **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL**) to store the weather data.
   - This could provide faster access to data and allow for more advanced querying.

### 7. **Deploy to Cloud**:
   - Host the Node.js backend on a cloud service like **Heroku** or **AWS**.
   - Serve the frontend on a CDN service like **Netlify** for better performance and scalability.
